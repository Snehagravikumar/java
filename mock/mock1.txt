1. *Java is object orintend,platform indenpent ,secure,robust programming language.
  *It is used to develope the application using API.
  *java and javac are the tools that is used excuete the programs.
  * Using javac(java Compiler) we complie the source code that will convert to byte code.
  * and java is extension given to to source code when compling code and it is used to run the byte code.


2. *JDK is the java development kit.
jdk is used to write  and exceute the code.
And it contains tools and JRE.

*JRE is the Java Runtime Environment.
It is used to Exceute only.
JRE contains the libraries and JVM.

*JVM is Java Virtual Machine.
it is used to exceute byte code.
JVM is java dependent.

3. .java file contains source code and it is used as extension in source code.
   .class file contains byte code and we can run this on any platform.

4. java IDE's 
   *Development Interface
   *platform Independent
   *Runtime Environment  
  

5.*Variable are used to Store the data .variable are type class level and method level.
  Class level have static and non-static variables.
eg: static String tarffic;//static variable
    String traffic; //non-static variable
 Method level have local and parameter variales.local variables are declared inside the method and parameter variable are declared within the method paranthesis.
  eg: void main()
  {
 String name;//local
  }

  void main(int number)//parameter
   {

   }

6.Object Oriented Programming means the java Independent langauge and the take real world entities by state and behaviour of those object.

7. error

8.data type is attribute that contains predefined types. and used to store the information in the specific type.
  data types 
Primitive datatypes
  * int 
eg: int number;//0
  * float
eg: float number;//0.0
  * char 
 eg: char size; space
  * double 
eg: double size; 0.0
  * boolean
eg: boolean type; trur/false
  * short
  * long 

Non-primitive datatypes
String 
array
and class name

9.Dot operator used to access variables and method.
    

10.Java Features
 *Polymorphism
 *Encapsulation
 *Abstraction
 *Inheritance

11.  Array is sequentail collection of similar data values or homogenous values.
and array is non primitive data type
   eg: String[] cities={"banglore","Mysore","hasan","davanagere"};

12.*class is keyword and non-primitive data type.
 And store the state and behaviour of real world objects.
 *object is instance of class.

13. keywords are reserved values in java.
   1.new,class,public
   2.static
   3.break
   4.this
   5.throw
   6.finally
   7.default
   8.case
   9.switch
   10.import
eg: class Keywords
{
  static int value;
public static void main(String[] args)
{
System.out.println("keywords");
}
}

14.Constructor is special method and it has same as class name .
 constructor do not have return type and use only new keyword.
 consturctor intialize the variables.
 type of constructor 
 1.defalut constructor
 2.parameteraized constructor

15.static give single copy and it is non-access specifier the main method becomes static.
   *implicit : we can directly give argument to called method.  
   *explicit : we can call method in decalred variable and that variable name will be passed as argument.

16. class Program
{
  int numbers[]={12,3,2,45,6,7,6}

  System.out.println("Total lenth of array is");

 for (int i=0;i<=numbers.length;i++)
{
System.out.println(number[i]);
}
}

17.Method is set statements.
 Method overloading is class have multiple method of same name with diffent parameter.
 eg: class Method
{
   static int add(int no, int cost)
{
}
static int add(int no, int cost ,int regno)
{
}
public static void main(String[] args)
{
System.out.println(Method.add(23,60));
 System.out.println(Method.add(23,60,104));  
}
}
